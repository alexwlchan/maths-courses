maths-courses
=============

A collection of notes for courses in the Cambridge Maths Tripos, typeset by me and released with permission from lecturers. Intended for students to use; please do not use them for teaching purposes without the explicit permission of both myself and the associated lecturer.

Currently available:

* IB *Geometry*, lectured in Lent&nbsp;2013 by Prof.&nbsp;Rasmussen.
* IB *Linear Algebra*, lectured in Michaelmas&nbsp;2012 by Prof.&nbsp;Grojnowski.
* IB *Metric and Topological Spaces*, lectured in Easter&nbsp;2012 by Prof.&nbsp;Wilson.
* Some custom notebook styles that I use for maths.

LaTeX files require XeLaTeX and style files `drangreport` and `drangsymbols`. In addition, certain courses require `awlc-algebra` and `awlc-statistics` (which provide subject-specific shortcuts and commands). This can be downloaded [from my `drangreport` GitHub repo][1].

I use a lot of packages in my work, so you may need to install new packages before the LaTeX files will compile. I explicitly *do not provide* assistance in getting these files to compile; they are provided "as is". I am, however, willing to discuss specific sections of the code if you have a particular question about how something works.
